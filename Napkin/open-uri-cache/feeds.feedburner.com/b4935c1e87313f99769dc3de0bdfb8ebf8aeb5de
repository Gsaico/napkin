    <title>Guest Post: The Origin Of Money</title>

&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/wrhKv4XZr8z9k_FAb8VX0LX93OU/1/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/wrhKv4XZr8z9k_FAb8VX0LX93OU/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submitted by John Aziz of &lt;a href="http://azizonomics.com/2012/07/01/the-origin-of-money/"&gt;Azizonomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Origin Of Money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are true democracies. The allocation of resources, capital  and labour is achieved through the mechanism of spending, and so based  on spending preferences. As money flows through the economy the popular  grows and the unpopular shrinks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Producers receive a signal to produce  more or less based on spending preferences. Markets distribute power  according to demand and productivity; the more you earn, the more power  you accumulate to allocate resources, capital and labour. As the power  to allocate resources (i.e. money) is widely desired, markets encourage  the development of skills, talents and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned economies have a track record of failure, in my view because  they do not have this democratic dimension. The state may claim to be  “scientific”, but as Hayek conclusively illustrated, the lack of any  real feedback mechanism has always led planned economies into hideous  misallocations of resources, the most egregious example being the  collectivisation of agriculture in both Maoist China and Soviet Russia  that led to mass starvation and millions of deaths. The market’s  resource allocation system is a complex, multi-dimensional process that  blends together the skills, knowledge, and ideas of society, and for  which there is no substitute. Socialism might claim to represent the  wider interests of society, but in adopting a system based on economic  planning, the wider interests and desires of society and the democratic  market process are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This complex process begins with the designation of money, which is why the choice of the monetary medium is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all democracies, markets can be corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoever creates the money holds a position of great power —  the choice of how to allocate resources is in their hands. They choose  who gets the money, and for what, and when. And they do this again and  again and again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who should create the monetary medium? Today, money is designated in  the ivory towers of central banks and allocated through the banking  system. Historically, in the days of commodity-money, money was  initially allocated by digging it up out of the ground. Anyone with a  shovel or a&amp;nbsp;gold pan&amp;nbsp;could create money. In the days of barter, a  monetary medium was created even more simply, through producing things  others were happy to swap or credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While central banks might claim that they have the nation’s best  democratic interests at heart, evidence shows that since the world  exited the gold exchange standard in 1971 (thus giving banks a monopoly  over the allocation of money and credit), bank assets as a percentage of  GDP have exploded (this data is from the United Kingdom, but there is a  similar pattern around the world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, some pigs are more equal than others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://azizonomics.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/uk-banking-assets-as-a-percentage-of-gdp.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://azizonomics.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/uk-banking-assets-as-a-percentage-of-gdp.jpeg?w=600&amp;amp;h=403" title="uk banking assets as a percentage of gdp" width="600" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4847" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving banks a monopoly over the allocation of capital has dramatically enriched banking interests. It is also correlated with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Fiat Money Kills&amp;nbsp;Productivity" href="http://azizonomics.com/2012/06/27/fiat-money-kills-productivity/"&gt;a dramatic fall in total factor productivity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title="Why the Left Misunderstands Income&amp;nbsp;Inequality" href="http://azizonomics.com/2012/04/19/why-the-left-misunderstands-income-inequality/"&gt;a dramatic increase in income inequality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very simply, &lt;strong&gt;I believe that the present system is inherently  undemocratic. Giving banks a monopoly over the initial allocation of  credit and money enriches the banks at the expense of society. Banks and  bankers — who produce nothing — allocate resources to their interests.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The rest of society — including all the productive sectors — get crumbs from the table.&lt;/strong&gt; The market mechanism is perverted, and bent in favour of the financial system. &lt;strong&gt;The financial system can subsidise incompetence and ineptitude through bailouts and helicopter drops.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a system is unsustainable. The subsidisation of incompetence  breeds more incompetence, and weakens the system, whether it is  government handing off corporate welfare to inept corporations, or  whether it is the central bank bailing out inept financial institutions.  The financial system never learned the lessons of 2008; &lt;a title="Double or Nothing: How Wall Street is Destroying&amp;nbsp;Itself" href="http://azizonomics.com/2012/05/12/double-or-nothing-how-wall-street-is-destroying-itself/"&gt;MF Global and the London Whale illustrate that&lt;/a&gt;.  Printing money to save broken systems just makes these systems more  fragile and prone to collapse. Ignoring the market mechanism, and the  interests of the wider society to subsidise the financial sector and  well-connected corporations just makes society angry and disaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our monopoly will eventually discredit itself through the subsidisation of graft and incompetence. It is just a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/K3OZYfT4SNk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <title>Barclays Chairman Is Lie-borgate's First Victim</title>
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/1HgCt9Q0tuw/barclays-chairman-lie-borgates-first-victim</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/2RrgTK5TVqqb5Vg4Cf8mdib4cxQ/0/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/2RrgTK5TVqqb5Vg4Cf8mdib4cxQ/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/2RrgTK5TVqqb5Vg4Cf8mdib4cxQ/1/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/2RrgTK5TVqqb5Vg4Cf8mdib4cxQ/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago we mocked, rightfully so, the utter &lt;a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/spirit-level-or-libor"&gt;joke that is Li&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;bor&lt;/a&gt;, which had been unchanged for just over 3 months. Nobody cared, certainly not the British Banker Association. This was not the first time: our first allegations of Li&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;bor fraud and manipulation started over three years ago. There were others too. Nobody certainly cared back then. Now, in the aftermath of the Barclays lawsuit, and "those" e-mails, everyone suddenly cares. And a few days after the first public exposure of Lie-borgate, the first victim has been claimed: as numerous sources report, Barclays' Chairman Marcus Agius wil step down immediately. From the WSJ: "Political and investor pressure has mounted on the management of U.K.-based Barclays since the settlement was announced Wednesday. The announcement of Mr. Agius's departure could come as soon as Monday, said one of the people. Mr. Agius, 65 years old, a British-Maltese banker who formerly worked at Lazard Ltd., has led the bank since 2007, steering Barclays through the 2008 financial crisis and avoiding the direct state bailouts that were needed by many of its global peers." While the sacrifice of a scapegoat is expected, what we don't get is why the Chairman: after all by the time Agius became Chair of the British bank, the bulk of the Libor fixing alleged in the FSA lawsuit had already happened. And of course, with Bob Diamond having succeeded John Varley as CEO in 2010, one can easily claim that in this first (of many) confirmed Li&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;bor transgression there really is nobody at fault who can be held accountable. Of course, Barclays is merely the first of many. We fully expect Li&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;borgate to spread not only to other British BBA member banks, but soon to jump across the Atlantic, where CEOs who have been with their banks for the duration of the entire Libor-fixing term will soon find themselves under the same microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/06/Indep%20Barclays.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/06/Indep%20Barclays_0.jpg" width="500" height="662" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304299704577500982100334286.html?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the U.K. government ordered an independent review of how Libor is set that is expected to be completed by the end of the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's very important [the review] takes all of the actions necessary, holding bankers accountable... making sure there's proper transparency, making sure the criminal law can go wherever it needs to uncover wrongdoing," Prime Minister David Cameron told BBC television Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said there should also be a criminal investigation into the Libor-fixing scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[The public] just can't understand why people are thrown into jail for petty theft and these guys just walk away having perpetrated what looks like conspiracy," Mr. Cable said told Sky television Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've been told the [Serious Fraud Office] is having a fresh look at the evidence," Mr. Cable said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King on Friday called for the current system for calculating Libor to be scrapped. Libor rates are calculated for different currencies each day under the auspices of the British Bankers' Association using quotes submitted by banks on a panel, based on the banks' estimated borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest irony in all of this what nobody talks about: namely that Li&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;bor has been completely irrelevant since 2009, when virtually all unsecured liquidity funding would come from central banks. In a world where Interbank lending has long been dead, Libor is merely the latest anachronism of free capital markets now that everything has been replaced by central planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if Barclays stock can tumble 20% in 3 days for the simple crime of interest rate rigging, we can only thank our lucky stars that the Federal Reserve has still not succumbed to the temptation to IPO itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/1HgCt9Q0tuw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <title>77% of JP Morgan’s Net Income Comes from Government Subsidies</title>
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/eydklZxtPY0/77-jp-morgan%E2%80%99s-net-income-comes-government-subsidies</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/HN1D-netO_OO0c02zPaVYdHRl84/0/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/HN1D-netO_OO0c02zPaVYdHRl84/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/HN1D-netO_OO0c02zPaVYdHRl84/1/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/HN1D-netO_OO0c02zPaVYdHRl84/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan&amp;rsquo;s credit rating would be much lower without government backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Bloomberg &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-22/jpmorgan-trading-loss-drove-three-level-standalone-cut.html" target="_blank" title="noted"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan benefited from the assumption that there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;very high likelihood&amp;rdquo; the U.S. government would back the bank&amp;rsquo;s bondholders and creditors if it defaulted on its debt, according to the statement. Without the implied federal backing, JPMorgan&amp;rsquo;s long-term deposit rating would have been three levels lower and its senior debt would have dropped two more steps, Moody&amp;rsquo;s said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the editors of Bloomberg &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-18/dear-mr-dimon-is-your-bank-getting-corporate-welfare-.html" target="_blank" title="pointed out"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan receives a government subsidy worth about $14 billion a year, according to research published by the International Monetary Fundand our own analysis of bank balance sheets. The money helps the bank pay big salaries and bonuses. More important, it distorts markets, fueling crises such as the recent subprime-lending disaster and the sovereign-debt debacle that is now threatening to destroy the euro and sink the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each new banking crisis, the value of the implicit subsidy grows. In a recent paper, two economists &amp;mdash; Kenichi Ueda of the IMF and Beatrice Weder Di Mauro of the University of Mainz &amp;mdash; estimated that as of 2009 the expectation of government support was shaving about 0.8 percentage point off large banks&amp;rsquo; borrowing costs. That&amp;rsquo;s up from 0.6 percentage point in 2007, before the financial crisis prompted a global round of bank bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To estimate the dollar value of the subsidy in the U.S., we multiplied it by the debt and deposits of 18 of the country&amp;rsquo;s largest banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. The result: about $76 billion a year. The number is roughly equivalent to the banks&amp;rsquo; total profits over the past 12 months, or more than the federal government spends every year on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&amp;rsquo;s share of the subsidy is &lt;strong&gt;$14 billion&lt;/strong&gt; a year, or about &lt;strong&gt;77 percent of its net income for the past four quarters&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, U.S. taxpayers helped foot the bill for the multibillion-dollar trading loss that is the focus of today&amp;rsquo;s hearing. They&amp;rsquo;ve also provided more direct support: Dimon noted in a recent conference call that the Home Affordable Refinancing Program, which allows banks to generate income by modifying government-guaranteed mortgages, made a significant contribution to JPMorgan&amp;rsquo;s earnings in the first three months of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way to &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/03/big-banks-continue-to-suck-at-the-government-teat-with-never-ending-stealth-bailouts.html" title="suck at the government teat"&gt;suck at the government teat&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. self-proclaimed &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/05/the-truth-about-jp-morgans-2-billion-loss.html" title="free market champion"&gt;free market champion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/eydklZxtPY0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <title>Calendar Of Key Events In Europe, Whose President Starting Today Is Broke Cyprus</title>
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/JMl4E6IDVyI/calendar-key-events-europe-whose-president-starting-today-broke-cyprus</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/_Lyl7A9IHtk1lNKQV9VfF8z2xeQ/0/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/_Lyl7A9IHtk1lNKQV9VfF8z2xeQ/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/_Lyl7A9IHtk1lNKQV9VfF8z2xeQ/1/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/_Lyl7A9IHtk1lNKQV9VfF8z2xeQ/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a development that is too hilarious for even the most hardened cynics to pass by, starting today, the rotating presidency of the EU will be handed over to... &lt;strong&gt;broke Cyprus. &lt;/strong&gt;We learn this and much more about the onslaught of sovereign debt auctions out of Spain and France in the month of July (explaining the urgency to come up with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;any &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;mechanism to keep Spanish and Italian bond yields below 7% as absent some deux ex, no matter how temporary, the whole charade may have ended as soon as 31 days from today) courtesy of the following calendar of key events out of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Deutsche Bank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 July:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyprus becomes EU President&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Cyprus will resume the six-month rotating presidency of the EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Merkel to meet Monti in Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 July: &lt;/strong&gt;ECB Governing Council meeting, followed by interest rate announcement and news conference. We expect a 25bp policy interest rate cut. The ECB may be reluctant to cut the deposit rate to zero. With easier collateral rules already announced on 22 June and the next Bank Lending Survey not due until 2 July, the policy moves on 5 July could be restricted to the cut in interest rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 July: &lt;/strong&gt;Spain auction. Bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9-10 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Eurogroup/ECOFIN finance ministers meeting. 9 July is to be the start date for ESM, successor to EFSF. This is also the date on which the Eurogroup is to formally approve the MoU on Spanish bank recapitalisation aid. Additionally, we might get more clarity on the interest rate charge that will come with the capital injection and on the duration of the loan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 July&lt;/strong&gt;: Greece auction. Bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy auction. Bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy auction. Bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Spain auction. Bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Greece auction. Bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 July&lt;/strong&gt;: Spain auction. Bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 July&lt;/strong&gt;: Spain auction. Bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25 Jul&lt;/strong&gt;y: ECB lending survey. The ECB is due to publish its third lending survey of the year on Wednesday 25 July. The survey could provide the ECB with a key piece of evidence to justify additional 3Y LTROs — if lending standards tighten again, another liquidity push may be necessary to avert a harsher credit crunch. The ECB plans to publish one more lending survey this year, on 31 October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 July&lt;/strong&gt;: Italy auction. Bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27 July&lt;/strong&gt;: Italy auction. Bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 July:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy auction. Bonds.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Public Opinion Of US Supreme Court Deteriorates Following Obamacare Decision</title>
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/qNLm4tZyWAw/public-opinion-us-supreme-court-deteriorates-following-obamacare-decision</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/-vSxRg42BxBX2WFmq1ot9IVY2Yc/0/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/-vSxRg42BxBX2WFmq1ot9IVY2Yc/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/-vSxRg42BxBX2WFmq1ot9IVY2Yc/1/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/-vSxRg42BxBX2WFmq1ot9IVY2Yc/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we are still collecting various public polling results showing popular sentiment in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's surprising Obamacare ruling last week, the first results out of Rasmussen show that if Judge John Roberts' goal was to somehow restory credibility in the supreme judicial entity, following his alleged flip flopping on the ACA, whereby he passed the Individual Mandate in a format never intended by the Obama administration, he has failed. From Rasmussen: "A week ago, 36% said the court was doing a good or an excellent job.  That’s down to 33% today. However, the big change is a rise in negative  perceptions. &lt;strong&gt;Today, 28% say the Supreme Court is doing a poor job. That’s up 11 points over the past week."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/supreme_court_update"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public opinion of the Supreme Court has grown more negative since the highly publicized ruling on the president’s health care law was released. A growing number now believe that the high court is too liberal and that justices pursue their own agenda rather than acting impartially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week ago, 36% said the court was doing a good or an excellent job. That’s down to 33% today. However, the big change is a rise in negative perceptions. &lt;strong&gt;Today, 28% say the Supreme Court is doing a poor job. That’s up 11 points over the past week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey, conducted on Friday and Saturday following the court ruling, finds that 56% believe justices pursue their own political agenda rather than generally remain impartial. That’s up five points from a week ago. Just half as many -- 27% -- believe the justices remain impartial. (To see survey question wording, click here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven percent (37%) now believe the Supreme Court is too liberal, while 22% think it's too conservative. A week ago, public opinion was much more evenly divided:&amp;nbsp; 32% said it was too liberal and 25% said too conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest survey, 31% now believe the balance is about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the SCOTUS is merely the latest entity to fall cleanly into the political class divide, showing that when ideology is concerned, Justice is certainly not blind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week ago, Republicans were generally positive about the court. Forty-two percent (42%) of GOP voters gave the justices good or excellent marks, while 14% said poor. Now, the numbers are strongly negative — 20% say good or excellent and 43% say poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Democrats, the numbers went from mixed to very positive. A week ago, 35% of those in the president’s party gave the high court positive reviews and 22% offered a negative assessment. Now, 50% are positive and only 11% give the high court negative marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for those not affiliated with either major party, the positives remained unchanged at 31%. However, among unaffiliated voters, the number rating the court's performance as poor doubled from 14% a week ago to 30% today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Political Class voters, positive ratings for the Supreme Court soared to 55%, compared to 27% a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Mainstream voters, the court’s ratings headed in the opposite direction. A week ago, 34% of Mainstream voters said the court was doing a good or excellent job and 17% gave it poor ratings. The numbers have now reversed — 22% positive and 36% negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats are now fairly evenly divided as to whether justices pursue their own agenda or remain impartial. However, by lopsided margins, Republicans and unaffiliated voters believe that they pursue their own agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up it is Germany's constitutional court to confirm that when it comes to preserving the status quo, impartial and objective ethics and values, not to mention laws and mores, are irrelevant. The only problem, there and here, is the one day at a time, taking liberty with the heretofore endless supplies of other people's money, which allowed everyone to keep a blind eye to the government's encroaching take over of all seemingly impartial institutions, is slowly ending, as the above mentioned "enablement" money is now practically gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no amount of "collateral expansions" by the ECB or other central banks can fix this realization at the heart of all modern-day problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/qNLm4tZyWAw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <title>Turkey Scrambles F-16s On Syria Border As US Intelligence Says Syrian Story Was Correct All Along</title>
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/8Ycg0Sswu4E/turkey-scrambles-f-16s-syria-border-us-says-syrian-story-was-correct-all-along</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/kUoIquUUlEOJU3fV_qDKWyeGNGg/0/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/kUoIquUUlEOJU3fV_qDKWyeGNGg/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/kUoIquUUlEOJU3fV_qDKWyeGNGg/1/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/kUoIquUUlEOJU3fV_qDKWyeGNGg/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/06/Syria%20WSJ.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/06/Syria%20WSJ_0.jpg" width="125" height="137" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last week's false flag story of baseless Middle Eastern provocation refuses to go away. Even after, in a shocking turn of events, US intelligence confirmed this weekend that &lt;strong&gt;Syria's version &lt;/strong&gt;of events surrounding the downed Turkish F-4 jet story was the right one all along, pulling the media narrative rug right from under Hillary Clinton's provocative feet (and making others wonder just which country is the only one that stands to benefit of NATO does pull Article 4 or 5 and does invade Syria on now invalidated and false premises), today we read that Turkey continues to try to escalate. &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18666165"&gt;From the BBC&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;strong&gt;Turkey has scrambled six F-16 fighters jets near its border with Syria after Syrian helicopters came close to the border, the country's army says&lt;/strong&gt;. A total of six jets were sent to the area in response to three such incidents on Sunday, &lt;strong&gt;although there was no border violation&lt;/strong&gt;, the Reuters news agency quoted the statement saying. On Friday, &lt;strong&gt;Turkey said it had begun deploying rocket launchers and anti-aircraft guns along the border in response to the downing of its F-4 Phantom jet&lt;/strong&gt;." Of course, without an actual confirmed provocation, such as the one Turkey itself pulled against Syria, it is left with the same media rhetoric that continues to expose just one side of the Syrian story - the Western media spun one. "Turkey has strongly criticised Syria's response to the 16-month anti-government uprising, which has seen more than 30,000 Syrian refugees enter Turkey." Fair enough, we do however wonder what Syria would say about Turkey's treatment of Kurdish minorities. Finally, confirmation that just as we first suggested two weeks, this whole incident has been nothing but a provocation stage test to get NATO involved without any of the facts being on the table, comes from no other source than US military intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304830704577497081567553846.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence indicates that a Turkish warplane shot down by Syrian forces was most likely hit by shore-based antiaircraft guns while it was inside Syrian airspace, American officials said, a finding in tune with Syria's account and at odds with Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turkish government, which moved tanks to the Syrian border after the June 22 incident, says the debris fell in Syrian waters, but maintains its fighter was shot down without warning in international airspace. Ankara also has said the jet was hit too far from Syrian territory to have been engaged by an antiaircraft gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damascus has said it shot down the plane with an antiaircraft battery with an effective range of about 1.5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We see no indication that it was shot down by a surface-to-air missile" as Turkey says, said a senior defense official. Officials declined to specify the sources of their information. The senior U.S. defense official cautioned that much remains unknown about the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally the truth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former senior U.S. official who worked closely with Turkey said he believed the flight's course was meant to test Syria's response.&lt;strong&gt; "You think that the airplane was there by mistake?"&lt;/strong&gt; the former official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;These countries are all testing how fast they get picked up and how fast someone responds&lt;/strong&gt;," said a senior U.S. official. "It's part of training."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turkish official said the plane wasn't on a surveillance mission. "All NATO members have condemned the Syrian hostile act and have supported Turkey," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gee, let's see here: confirmed self-defense and yet "all NATO members" are promptly on the side of the aggressor. How original. Finally, there's this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Turkish relationship is unlikely to be affected by the apparent discrepancies in accounts of the downing of the jet. Cooperation between Ankara and Washington has grown closer in recent months, after a period of significant strain in 2009 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That marks a turnaround for Turkey, which 18 months ago moved to cultivate relations and trade with neighboring Muslim regimes, including Mr. Assad's, &lt;strong&gt;while downgrading ties with former ally Israel&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;raising concerns in Washington&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question: now that the US has openly sold Turkey down the river, was this whole plan merely one spun out of that other "former ally" which after seeing its provocative clout vis-a-vis Iran's "despotic dictators" evaporate, is urgently trying to come up with other locus of potential warmongering? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as long as NATO has the back of any aggressor no matter what the facts say, all is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/8Ycg0Sswu4E" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <title>Is The Bank Of England About To Be Dragged Into Lie-borgate, And Which US Bank Is Next</title>
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/wFqYO5dYffY/bank-england-about-be-dragged-lie-borgate-and-which-us-bank-next</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/QQxe5HqF1j6O9v_qYeVWR4PzINw/0/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/QQxe5HqF1j6O9v_qYeVWR4PzINw/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/QQxe5HqF1j6O9v_qYeVWR4PzINw/1/da"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/QQxe5HqF1j6O9v_qYeVWR4PzINw/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Li&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;borgate scandal gathers steam not so much because of people's comprehension of just what is at stake here (nothing less than the fair value of $350 trillion in interest-rate sensitive products as explained &lt;a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/manipulation-and-abuse-confirmed-350-trillion-market"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;), but simply courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/shocking-details-barclays-epic-lie-bor-fraud-duuuude%E2%80%A6whats-ur-guys-345-3m-fix%E2%80%A6tell-him-get-it"&gt;several very vivid emails &lt;/a&gt;which mention expensive bottles of champagne, once again proving that when it comes to interacting with the outside world, banks see nothing but rows of clueless muppets until caught red-handed (at which point they &lt;a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/bruno-iksils-guide-surviving-status-quo-baffle-them-bullshit"&gt;use big words, and speak confidently&lt;/a&gt;), the BBC's Robert Peston brings an unexpected actor into the fray: &lt;strong&gt;the English Central Bank &lt;/strong&gt;and specifically Paul Tucker, the man who, unless Goldman's-cum-&lt;a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/goldman-path-complete-world-domination-mark-carney-his-way-head-bank-england"&gt;Canada's Mark Carney &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/second-baby-squid-rumored-be-running-bank-england-head-position"&gt;Goldman's Jim O'Neill step&lt;/a&gt; up, will replace Mervyn King as head of the BOE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18665080"&gt;From the BBC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In making false submissions about their borrowing costs, managers at Barclays believed they were operating under an instruction from Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, I have learned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This belief was fostered after a telephone conversation in the autumn of 2008 between Mr Tucker and Bob Diamond, who at the time ran Barclays' investment bank, Barclays Capital, and is today chief executive of Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the matter is that in 2008, at the height of the credit crunch, the perception of banks' financial strength was linked to how much they had to pay to borrow. Barclays managers were very worried that the appearance of the bank paying more to borrow than other banks was damaging confidence in its health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Barclays so-called "submitters", the managers who gave borrowing data to the British Bankers Association's Libor-setting committees, consistently told these committees that Barclays was paying a lower interest rate to borrow than was actually the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is striking is that after their conversation took place, senior Barclays' management on October 29 2008 gave an explicit instruction to reduce Libor submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope it comes as no surprise to anyone that central banks, already known to sell Treasury puts in order to game interest rates on global benchmark securities, would go so far as to advise BBA member (which as noted last week was shocked to find that epic manipulation was going on here) banks to do all in their power to lie and cheat to the market in order to avoid the perception of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet here is the punchline in Peston's piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is striking is that even the artificially suppressed quotes for Barclays' borrowing costs provided to the BBA committee were higher than other banks' quotes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which conveniently brings us once again to our piece from &lt;a href="http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-makes-no-sense-libor-by-bank.html"&gt;January 22, 2009 &lt;/a&gt;when the market was crashing every single day, when the world's central banks would do anything to halt the collapse in risk and asset prices, up to an including telling their host banks to lie about funding conditions, before the real QE1 was announced back in the middle of March, in which we made just this speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="quote_start"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="quote_end"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows there is something very screwy about LIBOR, with opinion ranging from it's way too high to the opposite. We also have been quite vocal in &lt;a href="http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/01/us-renaissance-late-ted-spread-blamed.html"&gt;our opinion of the TED Spread &lt;/a&gt;but that's irrelevant for the time being. Lately we have been looking at the most recent BBA data for the 3 month LIBOR submission by bank and while the average is 1.122%, the range is quite wide: 1.04% at the tight end to 1.204% at the wide. What confuses us is that the banks that submitted the lowest rates are the ones that have the most governmental independence, notably BofA and JPM, while the other end of the range is represented by pseudo nationalized banks such as RBS, in which the UK government recently acquired a 70% stake, and UBS, which had all of its bad assets swept by the Swiss National Bank in exchange for a loan (read more about the Swiss model here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/06/Liborbybank.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/06/Liborbybank.jpg" width="464" height="218" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication is that with more governmental involvement or even virtual nationalization, the cost to lend to another bank creeps higher, when compared to entities such as BofA and JPM which still, at least theoretically, carry all their bad assets on their books.&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; This intuitively is very confusing as the cheapest LIBOR should come from the nationalized entities, that have a full governmental backstop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while LIBOR's moves in itself have been very puzzling lately, the components of LIBOR and their relative values provide an additional layer to the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three and a half years later the puzzle is no more: it was all one big epic fraud, pardon, no fraud, as the CFTC and SEC settlements never admitted or denied fraud. Let's just call it benign market manipulation of a $350 trillion market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what the table above brings up are some curious observations: note the banks that in the middle of January were telegraphing to the world they were the healthiest via the one metric that was actually still relevant: 3 Month USD funding costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that Barclays has been exposed to be manipulating Libor on an epic scale. &lt;strong&gt;And even with all this, it still could manage to only be in the third best quartile&lt;/strong&gt;? If they were manipulating their Libor submissions they sure sucked at it. Which of course is why even the BOE got involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it begs the question: what about the Libor submissions of the three then "healthiest" banks: Bank of America, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. If Barclays was manipulating and gaming Lie-bor, only to fall even below the median submission, does this mean that these three banks were all furiously coming up with totally meaningless numbers? And how long until the SEC comes up with a US scapegoat bank to mimic the FSA's bold action on Barclays? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, and this is a big &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt;, the SEC does for once do something proactive in its illustrious career of corrupt, incompetent complacency and co-option, not to mention pornoholic hypnosis, the next and final question becomes: will it be Bank of America, or JP Morgan... and just how will the market react to the knowledge that two of the world's biggest non-nationalized banks participated in what as many have been warning for years, the biggest market manipulation fraud in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the BOE ends up getting crucified for Barclays' stunning email disclosure, will the Fed, which certainly had a role to play in all of this, be once again left untouched?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/wFqYO5dYffY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
